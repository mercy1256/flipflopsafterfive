### Day 4: Stay in Vik
- Gjáin Valley: depending on when you visit the f-327road to Gjáin Valley might be closed, if it is closed you can park the car at Hjálparfoss and walk to Stöng viking house on the f-327 road it is around 8 km. Do not miss the hike because of this walk, it is one of the most beautiful valley in Iceland. From the viking house there is around 2 hour flat hike to the valley where you can literally walk in the valley and cross the river. The water dance of Aarya was shot here and the whole area is just stunning.
- Haifoss waterfall: keep 30 mins to explore here (it is another 1 hour walk to reach here if the f-327 road is closed but it is also worth it)

### Day 5: Stay in Vik
- Go to Katla Ice Cave: I would recommned to book a tour to this cave, it is a cave that is formed by the Katla volcano and is a very unique experience.
- Go to Skógafoss waterfall: keep 2 hours to explore here, hint go on to the top of the waterfall and hike a bit further this hike is around 27 km long to thorsmork, you dont need to do the whole hike but go until you can there are couple of waterfalls just behind skogafoss and the nature here is amazing so explore at your own pace.
- Visit the Kvernufoss waterfall: it is 5 min drive from Skógafoss waterfall and is a beautiful waterfall. I would keep around 1 hour to explore here.
- Visit the Sólheimasandur plane wreck: it is a plane wreck that is on the road to Skógafoss waterfall and is a very unique experience. The problem is you need to walk 1 hour from parking to get here and in the end it did not feel like it was worth it. We did it because I wanted the drone shot of the plane but otherwise it was a bit of a let down
- Go to Reynisfjara black sand beach: keep 30 mins to explore here, be careful here as people die here because of the sneaker waves, see on the beach there is a warning system based on the weather how far you should go on the beach, do not risk to go to the cave if the warning system is telling you not to go.

### Day 6 Stay near Fjaðrárgljúfur canyon
- Fjaðrárgljúfur canyon: keep 2 hours to explore here, it is a beautiful canyon and very easily accessible.
- Thakgil canyon: it is around 1 hour drive from Vik. The drive is a bit tricky there is a camper van parking at the end of the road. The valley is absolutely the best thing I saw in my life. At the camping parking you can see multiple hikes depending on how much time you have. Ask the person at the counter of parking, we did the purple one which is not mentioned on the map, but gives the best views, the ascent and the descent is very steep especially if you have fear of heights but it is worth it. The other side of the valley looks like a different planet. Just trust me and go there. The purple hike was supposed to be 2 hour long we ended up spending 7 hours, there is just so much to see on the route and so many pictures to take.

### Day 7 Stay in Hofn
- Skaftafell National Park: go to svartifoss (keep 2 hour to explore here)
- Múlagljúfur canyon: The canyon is not marked on the road but you will find it in google maps. The hike is around 4-5 hours to the top of the mountain, don't stop at the viewpoint of the waterfall and the canyon, there are 3 more waterfall and at the end there is a glacier view. Basically go until the top of the mountain, you will not see the glacies until you are literally at the last 20 m of the hike but it is so worth it.
- Jökulsárlón glacier lagoon: keep 1 hour to explore here and the diamond beach. Also try to spot some seals if you can. If you are in time you can also do canoeing in the lagoon but you need to book in advance.
