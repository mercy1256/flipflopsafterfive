Iceland is one of the best countries in the world for flying a drone. With its epic landscapes, canyons, stunning waterfalls, and fjords, it’s a paradise for capturing incredible drone footage. However, due to the increasing number of tourists, there are some restrictions on where you can fly your drone. Many popular tourist spots are designated as no-fly zones, and the regulations are constantly being updated, making it challenging to find the most current information.

In this guide, I’ll compile a list of spots where drone flying was allowed when I visited, along with some of my favorite locations. I’ll also include links to resources where you can find up-to-date information on drone regulations in Iceland.

## Important sources of information

- [Current drone flying guidelines and permit application](https://www.ust.is/english/visiting-iceland/drones-in-protected-areas/)

> **Tip:** On top of this, please keep the general rules of drone flying in mind and avoid flying in risky conditions.

## Fjaðrárgljúfur Canyon

This is the first and only place in Iceland where I found a sign explicitly indicating that drone flying is permitted. It’s also one of the most stunning spots in the country, with a beautiful canyon perfect for capturing incredible drone footage.

However, this location is popular for drone flying, so you’ll often find several other people flying drones at the same time. When I visited, there were already four people flying drones. Depending on everyone’s skill level, this can be risky.

> **Tip:** Visit early in the morning or late in the evening to avoid the crowds.

## Þakgil Canyon

Another incredible spot where I captured some of the best footage from my trip. The only area where drone flying is prohibited is the campground. During the hike, I was able to capture some breathtaking, otherworldly landscapes and took a few shots while exploring the valley.

> The landscape here is truly unique, offering footage you won’t find anywhere else.

## Katla Ice Cave

During our ice cave tour, I asked the guide if I could fly my drone, and they agreed as long as I did it within the short free time we had to explore. I managed to capture the iconic Instagram shot of a drone flying through the ice cave—like a gateway to another dimension.

The aerial view of the ice cave against the volcanic surroundings was equally stunning.

## Glymur Waterfall

On the hike to Glymur Waterfall, there are several viewpoints overlooking the valley that offer incredible opportunities for drone photography. You can get creative and capture classic shots, like slowly pulling back to reveal the vastness of the valley while standing on a cliff.

## Klifbrekkufossar

This multi-layered waterfall cascades into the sea at the mouth of a fjord, creating a perfect setting for an epic drone shot.

> With everything you need for stunning footage, this spot speaks for itself.

## Stuðlagil Canyon

This is another popular drone spot but comes with a warning:

- **Challenges:** Basalt columns, narrow canyon, and strong winds.
- **Risks:** High chance of losing control of your drone.
- **Sensor issues:** The narrow valley can cause your drone to lose its sense of positioning.

> I lost my drone here, after it started misbehaving, the hover feature malfunctioned because of some sensor issue and strong winds and the signal from the controller was lost the wind took it straight to the column and then it fell down in the canyon. So be careful here, if you look at reddit you will see a lot of people having issues here with their drones, my tip would be if you really fly here keep it high and not low between the columns.

This spot is well-known for drone flying, so expect some air traffic. If you can navigate the challenges, you’ll be rewarded with truly incredible shots.

## Hraunfossar, Bruarfoss, and Þórufoss

All three waterfalls are fantastic locations for drone shots:

- **Hraunfossar & Bruarfoss:** Can be crowded; harder to get shots without people.
- **Þórufoss:** Usually less crowded, providing great opportunities for unobstructed drone footage.

Enjoy flying and stay safe!
