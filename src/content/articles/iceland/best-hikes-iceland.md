In this article I would like to add my favourite hikes in Iceland along with some tips about how to best visit them.

## Þakgil

This valley turned out to be one of the best places we visited in Iceland. It is in my opinion one of the best hikes in Iceland. It's located about 40 minutes from Vik, with the last 20 km being a challenging but incredibly scenic drive. Be prepared to stop frequently for photos—the views along the road are breathtaking, and there are plenty of spots to pull over and take it all in.

Although the road isn't classified as an F road, it can still be quite difficult to navigate. You'll drive until you reach the parking lot near the camping area, where you'll find several marked hiking trails. There's an information board at the parking lot that provides details about the trails. I recommend setting aside an entire day to explore this area if possible.

If you're pressed for time like I was, you can ask at the campground reception about a shorter trail. They suggested a one-hour route that covers the best viewpoints. After completing it, I'd estimate it takes most hikers around two hours, but we spent five hours in total. The views from the top are so spectacular that one viewpoint feels like you're on a different planet.

**In conclusion**, if you're near Vik, don't miss this valley—it's truly a must-see.

## Glymur Waterfall

Glymur Waterfall is a hidden gem within driving distance of Reykjavik, beautifully nestled in a fjord. This multi-layered waterfall reveals its full splendor only when you're close to it. The journey makes the experience even more rewarding.

In summer, a hiking trail lets you cross the river using a log and ascend the opposite side. However, when we visited, the river crossing wasn't accessible. We climbed to the top on our side of the river instead. The hike is somewhat challenging, but I highly recommend reaching the summit. From the top, you'll enjoy breathtaking views of the waterfall and fjord. These views remain hidden until you reach the summit.

At the top, you can explore behind the waterfall and cross the river. You may also descend along the other side or follow a marked trail leading back to the parking area. We chose this trail due to time constraints.

**Tip**: Set aside at least eight hours to fully enjoy Glymur Waterfall. We spent seven hours and wished we had more time. Be sure to hike to the top; the views and experience are unforgettable.

## Gjáin Valley

Any list of best hiking places in Iceland is not complete until this hike is included in it. Gjáin turned out to be my favorite spot in Iceland. To reach it, you need to take an F-road for the last 8 km, accessible only by car in summer. When we visited, the road hadn't opened yet, so we walked the 8 km, which felt like walking on Mars due to the barren, black landscape.

To get there, you start at Stöng guesthouse, either by foot or car. If the road is open, you can drive to the nearby parking lot, but I recommend hiking from the guesthouse for a fuller experience. The first 30 minutes were easy, though we initially felt underwhelmed by the distant view of the valley.

However, once you enter the valley and cross the river, the magic unfolds. As we reached the first waterfall—filming location for Arya and The Hound's "Water Dance" in *Game of Thrones*—we were truly impressed. Exploring further, we found a cave and crossed the river into the valley, where we were greeted by breathtaking views and vibrant flora.

The experience was one-of-a-kind, as we explored the valley from below, an unusual perspective in Iceland. Since the road was closed, we had the entire valley to ourselves, surrounded by nothing but nature's sounds. It was surreal.

**Time needed**: Plan for a full day here. The total hike takes about three hours, but we spent around eight hours, soaking in the beauty and taking endless photos.

## Fjaðrárgljúfur Canyon

Fjaðrárgljúfur Canyon is a stunning spot located between Vik and Höfn. It's easily accessible, and while the hike is more of a leisurely walk, the views are absolutely breathtaking. You'll need about two hours to explore the canyon, as walking from one end to the other takes around 50 minutes. Though the walk is straightforward, the scenery is incredible.

Be sure to walk all the way to the end, where you'll find a waterfall that's only visible from that point. There are parking lots at both ends of the canyon, and with only one path, the trail is easy to follow. If you're in the area, this is a must-visit short hike—the views you get for such little effort are truly amazing.

## Mulagljufur Canyon

This was another unforgettable hike we did in Iceland. There aren't any road signs to the canyon. Luckily, someone pinned the location on Google Maps, which accurately guides you to the parking lot. From the parking lot, there are several marked trails in different colors. We couldn't find any guides explaining the differences between them. The canyon is visible from the parking area, so follow any trail in that direction to reach it.

The hike is somewhat strenuous. First, you descend into the valley, cross a river, and then face a steep climb. It took us about an hour to reach the first viewpoint. Another 30 minutes brought us to the main viewpoint of the canyon. Most people turn back here, but I recommend continuing if you're adventurous. The trail becomes more challenging, with the marked path fading and steep elevation ahead. However, the effort is worth it.

At the mountain's summit, you'll be rewarded with a stunning 360° view of the canyon and glacier. The glacier stays hidden until you reach the top. The full hike takes 1 hour and 30 minutes to the main viewpoint. It's another 1 hour and 30 minutes to reach the absolute top.

**Suggested duration**: Allow about seven hours total for the hike. This canyon is unique, and I strongly recommend not missing it.
