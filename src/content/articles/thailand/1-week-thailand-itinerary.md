**Tips & Notes**  
- **Weather:** Expect tropical heat and occasional showers. Pack light, breathable clothing and a raincoat.  
- **Transport:** Taxis and tuk-tuks are plentiful, but negotiate fares or ensure the meter is used. Ferries and speedboats connect the islands—book tickets in advance during high season.  
- **Culture:** Remove shoes before entering temples, and be mindful of local customs. A small Thai phrasebook or translation app goes a long way!

Enjoy your journey through Thailand’s diverse landscapes, from island paradises to vibrant urban streets!
