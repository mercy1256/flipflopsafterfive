In this week I want to share an itinerary of how I spent 2 weeks around Spain. My purpose with this blogpost is to help people decide and plan on their itineraries. You can extend or shorten this itinerary according to the duration of your stay and also your taste of locations. I try to cover some natural locations, beach days and also the visits to museums in the cities so there is something for everyone.

## Day 1: Barcelona

Our first day was a bit short as we landed in Girona the night before and arrived in Barcelona in the afternoon on this day. So it was a short day for us.

**Parc Güell**  
This is a big park with some amazing architecture. It is a bit far out of the city so keep around 1 hr 30 minutes (via public transport) to travel and go back to the city. It has some amazing architecture so if it is your first time in the city I would not skip it.  
*Tip:* You have to get a ticket and it is better to book it a day in advance as spot entry could be tricky in peak tourist season.

**Temple of the Sacred Heart of Jesus**  
This is around 45 minutes away from Parc Güell. It is very interesting as it gives you a very beautiful view of Barcelona from the top. Going on the top requires a cable car ticket of 12 euros.

## Day 2: Barcelona

**Sagrada Familia**  
The most visited place on a trip to Barcelona is not to be missed. I highly recommend booking your entry spot 2–3 weeks in advance, as it tends to be fully booked.  
While I don’t need to say much about its significance, I will share this: I’ve seen many beautiful churches during my travels through Italy, and I live in Germany, where incredible churches are everywhere. I’m quite accustomed to stunning church architecture, but the only other church that impressed me as much was Santa Maria Novella in Florence. So, I strongly encourage you not to miss this site and to allocate enough time to explore it thoroughly. We spent around 3 hours there.

**Gothic Quarters, Casa Batlló, Casa Amatller**  
The rest of the day, we explored the old town of Barcelona and admired the stunning architecture of Casa Batlló and Casa Amatller. Both buildings are impressive from the outside, but we chose not to go inside as we were short on time and wanted to save some money—entry fees at these places can add up quickly.  
We also visited Camp Nou since I’m a big football fan and wanted to buy an FC Barcelona jersey. You might consider skipping one of these spots to spend more time at the others, depending on your interests.

**Barceloneta Beach**  
There are a few beaches next to each other, and I really enjoyed the atmosphere at all of them. They have volleyball courts and other amenities, so we arrived around 5 PM, took a dip, and played some volleyball. I highly recommend spending some time here.

## Day 3: Montserrat

We decided to take a day trip from Barcelona to Montserrat. There’s a monastery at the top of the mountain and plenty of hiking opportunities. You can take a direct train from Barcelona, and from there, you have two options to reach the top:

- A mountain train (45 minutes)
- A cable car (15 minutes)

*Note:* The cable car isn’t for the faint-hearted, as the drop is quite steep.

At the top, we visited the monastery before starting our hike to **Sant Jeroni**. The hike is a bit challenging, with dense forest and significant elevation gain. It takes about 2 hours uphill and 1.5 hours downhill. The views from the top are absolutely stunning.

## Day 4: Madrid

We took a morning train from Barcelona to Madrid (our stay for the next 3 days), so the first half was mostly travel.

**Museo Del Prado**  
It is consistently ranked one of the top 10 museums in the world with a huge collection of art. We spent 4.5 hours here.  
*Tip:* If you're an EU resident (not necessarily a citizen), museums offer free entry in the last 2 hours of operation.

**El Retiro Park**  
A beautiful park in the middle of Madrid. Worth strolling through, especially while looking for a place to eat.

## Day 5: Madrid

**Walking City Tour**  
A 3-hour walking tour through Madrid covering all the main attractions: Puerta del Sol, Plaza Mayor, and more. We learned the history of those places and some interesting urban legends.

**Santiago Bernabeu Stadium**  
Only worth it if you're a football fan—it's quite far from the city center.

**Royal Palace of Madrid**  
We used the free entry in the last 2 hours option here. It's not very large (in terms of public access), and we finished the tour in 1.5 hours. Beautiful interiors—definitely worth a visit.

## Day 6: Valencia (Day Trip)

We did a day trip from Madrid to Valencia (2 hours one way).

**Oceanografic**  
The biggest aquarium in Europe—worth a visit. Entry is a bit expensive, but it's enjoyable for adults too. Keep at least 3 hours for it.

**Ciudad de las Artes y las Ciencias**  
Walk along the science city; the architecture is impressive.

**Old Town**  
Charming European old town, perfect for a relaxing stroll.

## Day 7: Malaga

We traveled to Malaga (our base for the next 6 days) from Madrid and reached in the evening. Just explored the city center and the port.

Malaga has an outstanding vibe. It's one of those cities I'd return to just to chill and enjoy walking along the port at night.

---

## Day 8: Sevilla

We rented a car starting this day and drove to Sevilla.

**Royal Alcazar of Sevilla**  
The most visited place in Sevilla. Allow at least 3 hours.  
Some scenes from *Game of Thrones* (Dorne) were filmed here! Also visit the adjacent cathedral and city center—it looks like Venice.

## Day 9: Malaga

This day was mostly reserved for personal errands, but we explored some of Malaga too.

**Malaga Cathedral**  
Located in the city center and worth a visit.

**Alcazaba of Malaga & Castillo de Gibralfaro**  
Hike to the Castillo for the best views of Malaga. For 5 euros, you can visit both the viewpoint and the Alcazaba + Roman Theater. Plan 3 hours for this.

**Museo Picasso Malaga**  
Picasso was born in Malaga. While his best work is elsewhere, this museum still has excellent pieces.

## Day 10: Caminito Del Rey + Ronda

One of the best days of our trip—off the typical tourist path.

**Ronda**  
1.5 hours from Malaga. Small town with a stunning bridge—looks like something out of *Lord of the Rings*. We hiked 30 minutes down for the best viewpoint.

**Caminito Del Rey**  
Once one of the world’s most dangerous hikes, now made accessible. A majestic canyon walk.  
*Tips:*  
- Book at least 2 weeks in advance.  
- You need a bus ticket from the parking area.  
- The guided tour was more fun and informative.

## Day 11: Granada

We drove to Granada (1.5 hours from Malaga).

**Alhambra Fort**  
Spain’s most famous fort. Book tickets **at least 2 months in advance**.  
Huge complex with castles, gardens, and views of Granada. Takes a full day to explore.

## Day 12: Marbella

Our last day in Spain. We first visited **Colomares Castle** (30 minutes from Malaga) for a short 30-minute stop. Beautiful mini castle.

Then we headed to **Marbella**, a coastal town perfect for relaxing. Although the beach had a bit of algae the day we went, the drive along the Mediterranean coast was stunning.
