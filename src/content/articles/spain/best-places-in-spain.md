In this article, I want to share my favorite places to visit in Spain from my recent trip. Just a heads-up: I’ve traveled extensively throughout Europe, and at this point, I’m quite familiar with the typical European cities, so you might notice a preference for less common tourist spots. However, these recommendations are still useful for those looking to add unique destinations to the usual city breaks. Most of these places are easily accessible by public transport from nearby cities, and during my trip, I myself also stayed in **Barcelona**, **Madrid**, and **Malaga**.

## Montserrat

Montserrat is just 50 minutes by train from Barcelona, and it’s home to an incredible monastery nestled within the mountains, offering plenty of hiking opportunities. You can purchase a return ticket that includes both the train ride from Barcelona and either a cable car or train ride to the top of Montserrat. There’s a direct local train from *Plaça de Espanya*.  
- If you’ve opted for the cable car, get off at **Aeri de Montserrat**.  
- If you chose the train ride to the top, get off at **Monistrol de Montserrat**.

The cable car ride takes about 15 minutes and offers breathtaking views, although it can be daunting if you’re afraid of heights. The train ride takes around 45 minutes to reach the top.

At the summit, I recommend purchasing tickets to explore the **monastery**, which is stunning inside. After that, we hiked to the **Sant Jeroni** viewpoint — the highest point of the mountain.  
- ⏱️ The hike takes about 2 hours one way and is quite challenging.  
- 🥾 Total time: ~5 hours for the hike.

Visiting Montserrat is one of the best and most unique experiences if you have an extra day in Barcelona.

## Caminito del Rey

This is a stunning hike in southern Spain, about an hour from Malaga, located between Malaga and Seville.  
- 🥾 The hike is roughly 2.5 hours through a beautiful canyon.  
- 🎫 Book entry **in advance** — choose either a guided or unguided tour.  
  - The **unguided** tour sells out quickly.  
  - We did the **guided** tour and enjoyed learning about the area's history.

The views are breathtaking, and the rugged terrain adds to the experience.

### Getting There:
- 🚌 Direct buses from Malaga  
- 🚗 Drive (last 3 km are tricky)  
  - From the car park, take a bus to the **north access point** (entry).  
  - You’ll exit at the **south access point** and bus back to the car.

⏱️ Allocate about 3 hours for the hike.

## Ronda

Ronda is a small town in southern Spain, between Seville and Malaga.  
While the town is charming, the **main highlight** is its dramatic **Puente Nuevo** bridge over a deep canyon.

### What to Do:
- Walk through the old town to reach the bridge and viewpoints.
- Then, descend into the canyon for the best views — about a **30-minute** walk.
- ⚠️ Some viewpoints along the path are owned by cafes that charge if you don’t buy anything. **Skip those.**  
  - The best viewpoint is further down and **free**.

### Getting There:
- 🚗 Drive (best if you're combining it with another destination)  
- 🚆 Train is also an option

📌 Tip: Ronda is a great **2-3 hour stop**, not a full-day destination.

## Sagrada Familia

In my opinion, this is one of the **most remarkable churches in the world**.  
Its architecture is completely unique — each façade tells its own story.

### Tips:
- 🎫 Book tickets a couple of weeks in advance.  
- 🎧 No need for a guided tour; the **free audio guide** is excellent.  
- 🚇 Metro access is super convenient — the **Sagrada Familia station** is right there.

Even if you’re not into architecture, this place will blow you away.

## Malaga (Port & Beach Area)

Specifically, I’m talking about the **port and beach area**.  
We stayed in Malaga for **6 days** while exploring southern Spain, and every evening we walked from the old town to the port.

### Why Visit:
- 🎶 Live music & dancing  
- 🌬️ Cool breeze  
- 🌅 Stunning sunsets  

This area **comes alive at night**, and the atmosphere is truly one of a kind.  
In fact, I’ve only seen similar vibes in **Dubrovnik** and **Porto**.  
If you can, spend a few days here. You won’t regret it — I’ll go back the first chance I get.

## Conclusion

This list highlights **my favorite places**, but it’s not exhaustive.  
I haven’t included more typical destinations like **Barcelona**, **Madrid**, **Seville**, and **Granada**, as they’re already popular (and yes, I visited those too).

To be honest, after extensive travel across Europe, these mainstream cities didn’t impress me as much.  
They’re worth visiting **once**, but the places listed above are ones I’d **gladly revisit**.
