In this post I want to share my itinerary of 10 days in mainland Portugal. I travelled solo in this trip and went everywhere via public transport but this itinerary can suit anyone who wants to travel along the country with a car as well.

## Day 1: Porto

**Clerigos Tower**: This is the main landmark of the city—a baroque tower adjacent to a beautiful church. For a small fee, you can climb the tower, and I highly recommend it, as it offers a great view of the city from the top.

**Livraria Lello**: As a Potterhead, visiting this bookstore was a must for me... A tip: if you purchase a book inside, the entry fee is refunded!

**Jardins do Palácio Cristal**: It’s a stunning park with great views of the Douro River and even has peacocks roaming around.

**Dom Luis I Bridge**: The main attraction of Porto... I witnessed the best sunset of my life here.

**São Bento Station**: One of the most beautiful train stations you’ll ever see, thanks to its stunning tile work.

## Day 2: Douro Valley

A day trip from Porto to Pinhão, a small town in the heart of the Douro Valley. The scenic train ride alone is worth the trip.

**Hiking Viewpoint**: About an hour hike gives a panoramic view of the valley.

**Boat Ride & Wine Tour**: A peaceful river ride and a wine tasting session in the oldest wine-producing region of Portugal.

**Praça do Comércio**: The main plaza, perfect for strolling and photography. Don’t miss Pink Street!

**Miradouro de São Pedro de Alcântara**: One of the best sunset viewpoints in Lisbon.
