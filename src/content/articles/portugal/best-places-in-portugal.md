## Praia Da Ursa

This is the most beautiful beach I’ve ever visited, and it holds a special place in my heart. I’ve seen my fair share of stunning beaches, but this one stands out. It’s a hidden gem, accessible only by hiking down a cliff for about an hour. While the hike can be a bit tricky, it’s manageable—even a couple of girls in flip-flops made it down with us. Because of its secluded location, the beach is not crowded, allowing you to fully appreciate the breathtaking beauty of the surrounding cliffs. It’s truly a remarkable spot!

## Quinta Da Regaleira

This is the best place to visit in Sintra, located in the opposite direction of Pena Palace. It was my favorite spot in Sintra and a must-see for anyone visiting the area. The estate is vast and absolutely stunning, with 10–15 notable locations within its grounds, each more impressive than the last. The surroundings are breathtaking, and if time allows, you could easily spend an entire day exploring. I would highly recommend visiting this estate even more than Pena Palace.

## Ribeira District in Porto and Sunset at Jardim do Morro

There are few places in the world where the vibe hits you like the Ribeira of Porto. On both sides of the Douro River, you’ll find charming lines of shops and street artists performing, creating an incredible atmosphere. There are also plenty of restaurants where you can enjoy your time here. Just above the Ribeira is Jardim do Morro, which offers the best sunset views in Porto. The ideal way to experience this area is to watch the stunning sunset at Jardim do Morro, then head down to the Ribeira for dinner at a restaurant, surrounded by the vibrant energy of street performers. Trust me, you won’t find a better experience anywhere else!

## The Seven Hanging Valleys Hike

You can start this hike at either Praia do Vale de Centeanes or Praia da Marinha, which is known as one of the most beautiful beaches in Europe. Often considered one of the most scenic hikes in Europe, this trail takes you along the cliffs of the coastline, offering stunning views the entire way. The hike takes around 3 hours one way and can be done in either direction. Along the way, you’ll pass by the famous Benagil Cave from above, as well as the beautiful Praia do Carvalho. The trail is a bit tiring but not overly difficult, and you’ll find yourself taking pictures non-stop.

To reach Praia do Vale de Centeanes by public transport, take a train to the Lagoa-Estombar station and then a bus to the beach. Make sure to check the bus schedule as they can be sporadic. The hike ends at Praia da Marinha, where you can catch a bus back to Lagoa-Estombar station and then take a train to Faro. If you miss the bus, Uber is also a reliable option in this area. This hike is not to be missed!
