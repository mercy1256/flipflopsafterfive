A winter trip to Finland is largely about the activities. Personally, I’m more drawn to unique experiences in Finland rather than just the places to visit. On my recent trip, I spent half my time in Levi, Lapland and the other half in the south. This list mainly highlights the fun activities I experienced in Lapland. If I had visited the south in the summer, it would have been included in this list as well.

## ❄️ Snowbiking

This was by far the most fun activity we did in Lapland. You rent an e-bike and ride it on biking trails through the forest, which combines elements of mountain biking and forest trails. It’s much more enjoyable than it sounds, though be prepared to fall quite a bit—and you’ll actually enjoy it! 

The snow can be so thick that the tires lose grip in certain areas, causing you to slip if you’re going fast. However, falling in the snow is painless and even fun. The snowy forest looks absolutely magical, making it feel like you’re in a fantasy world.

You can typically rent the bike for a whole day, so after finishing one trail, we explored another one on a frozen lake, which was also an incredible experience. I highly recommend giving this a try.

## 🎅 Visiting Santa Claus Village

If you have children, this will undoubtedly be one of your most important activities, but it’s also incredibly fun for adults. There’s so much to do here:

- Cross the Arctic Circle (and get a certificate!)
- Meet Santa
- Go on a reindeer or husky safari
- Horse rides
- Send letters from Santa’s post office

There’s something for everyone. The place is also stunningly beautiful, so if you’re visiting in winter, it’s a must-do activity.

## 🐕 Husky Safari

I went on a husky safari near a husky farm around Levi. Any husky farm with good access to the forest is a great choice, as the safari itself is enjoyable, and riding through a forest is particularly stunning.

I would recommend this over a reindeer safari because the speed is exhilarating and really boosts your adrenaline.

## 🧊 Taking a Dip in a Frozen Lake

There are saunas you can visit that offer the option to take a cold dip in a frozen lake followed by an immediate return to the sauna. This traditional practice, used by the Sami people, is considered very healthy for your body.

I tried it, and it was amazing. The cold dip was so intense that I could barely breathe, but you only need to stay in the cold water for about 30 seconds. Afterwards, I was walking around at the edge of a forest near a frozen lake with just a towel on, and I didn’t feel cold at all.

## 🛷 Snowmobile Safari

You can take a snowmobile safari that either takes you to the top of a mountain through a forest or across frozen lakes. You can choose your preferred setting, and both options are enjoyable.

I highly recommend this experience, as it is unique to the area and, in my opinion, well worth it.

## 🥾 Snowshoe Hiking

Another unique experience that turned out to be much more fun than expected. I highly recommend this activity, as it’s easy to do and allows you to hike through thick snow using special gear, which adds to the enjoyment.

I suggest opting for a guided tour; our guide took us a bit farther from town and was very knowledgeable about the area and wildlife spotting. We even managed to see wild arctic foxes and rabbits, which are quite difficult to spot.

## 🧭 Conclusion

These were my favorite activities in Lapland. Of course, there are other options, like cross-country skiing, which we didn’t try but would likely be just as fun. There were also some activities we tried, like the reindeer safari, that I found just okay.

I hope this post helps you with planning your trip.
