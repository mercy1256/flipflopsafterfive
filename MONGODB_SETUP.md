# MongoDB Contact Form Setup Complete! 🎉

Your contact form is now fully integrated with MongoDB Atlas! Here's what you need to do to complete the setup:

## 🔧 Required Setup Steps

### 1. Create Environment File
Create a `.env.local` file in your project root with:

```env
# MongoDB Configuration (Already set up!)
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://travelsocial82:mxHnQskgNFlndZ2L@cluster0.owloean.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0

# Email Configuration (You need to set these!)
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
```

### 2. Set Up Email (Required for Contact Form to Work)

#### For Gmail:
1. Go to [Google Account Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/)
2. Navigate to **Security**
3. Enable **2-Step Verification** if not already enabled
4. Go to **App passwords**
5. Select **Mail** and **Other (Custom name)**
6. Generate the password and use it in `EMAIL_PASS`

#### For Outlook/Hotmail:
```env
EMAIL_SERVICE=outlook
EMAIL_USER=your-email@outlook.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-password
```

#### For Yahoo:
```env
EMAIL_SERVICE=yahoo
EMAIL_USER=your-email@yahoo.com

```

## 🚀 What's Now Working

✅ **Contact Form**: Stores submissions in MongoDB  
✅ **Email Notifications**: You get notified of new submissions  
✅ **User Confirmations**: Users get confirmation emails  
✅ **Admin Panel**: View and manage submissions at `/admin/contact-submissions`  
✅ **Database Storage**: All submissions stored with timestamps and status  

## 📊 Admin Panel Access

Visit `/admin/contact-submissions` to:
- View all contact form submissions
- Update submission status (new, read, replied, archived)
- Reply to users directly
- Copy user emails

**Note**: The admin panel currently uses a simple token system. For production, consider implementing proper authentication.

## 🧪 Testing

1. **Test the Contact Form**: Fill out and submit the form at `/contact`
2. **Check Your Email**: You should receive a notification
3. **Check MongoDB**: Data should appear in your `flipflopsafterfive` database
4. **Check Admin Panel**: Visit `/admin/contact-submissions`

## 🗄️ Database Structure

Your MongoDB database will have a `contacts` collection with documents like:

```json
{
  "_id": "unique_id",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "subject": "Travel Question",
  "message": "Hello, I have a question about...",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "status": "new"
}
```
